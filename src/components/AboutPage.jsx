                    🎨 Hi, I’m <span className="highlight">Adeena Sajjad</span>, a passionate sketch artist and painter with a deep love for visual storytelling. Every line I draw and every brushstroke I paint is a whisper of emotion, a memory, or a dream.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🖌️ My specialties include <span className="highlight">realistic portraits, minimalist sketches, abstract visuals, and custom commissions</span>. I work with a variety of mediums — from graphite, charcoal, ink, and watercolor to digital canvases using Procreate and Photoshop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🧰 My tools are as diverse as my imagination: Staedtler pencils, Faber-Castell charcoal, Copic markers, and brushes that feel like an extension of my soul.
                </p>

                <p>
                    🏆 I’ve proudly showcased my work in several exhibitions such as <span className="highlight">“Lines of Thought – Lahore (2023)”</span> and <span className="highlight">“Impression of a Mind – Karachi (2022)”</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    💭 I believe art isn’t what you see with your eyes — it’s what you feel in your heart. My goal is to make people pause, reflect, and feel something real.
                </p>
